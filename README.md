A Dyslexia Detection & Support Platform

Akshar Mitr is an accessibility-focused web application designed to detect early signs of dyslexia and provide supportive tools for learners. It integrates OCR, speech recognition, eye tracking, handwriting analysis, and quizzes into a unified system, with gamified assessments and reading support for detected cases.

🌟 Features
OCR Recognition: Extracts text features using EasyOCR.

Speech Recognition: Converts spoken input into text using OpenAI Whisper.

Eye Tracking: Monitors eye movement patterns with WebGazer.js and OpenCV.

Handwriting Analysis: Processes handwriting logs for deeper detection.

Interactive Quiz: Provides cognitive and reading-based assessments.

Gamified Assessment: Engages learners with interactive tasks if dyslexia is detected.

Reading Support Tool: Offers personalized assistance for learners with dyslexia.

📚 Research & Publications
We are proud to share that Akshar Mitra: A Multimodal Integrated Framework for Early Dyslexia Detection has been published in the SCIE journal Digital Health.

This work presents Akshar Mitra, an integrated multimodal framework aimed at enabling early detection of dyslexia through OCR, speech recognition, eye tracking, handwriting analysis, and gamified assessments.
